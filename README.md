# The Lovett School Makers Club

This is the website for the Makers Club, which on the surface seems pretty simple, but what's new here is a fully-functioning CMS system that I built underneath it. Essentially a simplified version of PHPMyAdmin, this system gives the ability to create, edit, and delete posts all from a password protected admin panel. While I would like to create a more secure system of verification than Apache's built in password-protected directories, this will have to do for now.
